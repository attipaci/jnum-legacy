# JNUM (Legacy Version)

Author: Attila Kovacs <attila[AT]sigmyne.com>


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Important Note

This is a **legacy** fork of [jnum](https://github.com/attipaci/jnum), created 
with the sole purpose of accompanying legacy **CRUSH** releases 
([crush-legacy](https://github.com/attipaci/crush-legacy)), with support for 
several astronomical cameras whose support was dropped from the mainline CRUSH 
at version 2.50 (or after). For any other purposes, you should be using the 
main-line repo, where all new development is taking place.
